/*
	starter.sql - updated 4/17/2014

	Here are a few notes on things below that may not be self evident:

	INDEXES: You'll see indexes below for example:

	INDEX SurveyID_index(SurveyID)

	Any field that has highly unique data that is either searched on or used as a join should be indexed, which speeds up a
	search on a tall table, but potentially slows down an add or delete

	TIMESTAMP: MySQL currently only supports one date field per table to be automatically updated with the current time.  We'll use a
	field in a few of the tables named LastUpdated:

	LastUpdated TIMESTAMP DEFAULT 0 ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

	The other date oriented field we are interested in, DateAdded we'll do by hand on insert with the MySQL function NOW().

	CASCADES: In order to avoid orphaned records in deletion of a Survey, we'll want to get rid of the associated Q & A, etc.
	We therefore want a 'cascading delete' in which the deletion of a Survey activates a 'cascade' of deletions in an
	associated table.  Here's what the syntax looks like:

	FOREIGN KEY (SurveyID) REFERENCES 16q2_surveys(SurveyID) ON DELETE CASCADE

	The above is from the Questions table, which stores a foreign key, SurveyID in it.  This line of code tags the foreign key to
	identify which associated records to delete.

	Be sure to check your cascades by deleting a survey and watch all the related table data disappear!
